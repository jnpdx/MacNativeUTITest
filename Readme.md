Target `MacNativeUTITest` should build and then run from the `Applications` folder. Once it's run, the file extension `.customuti` should be associated with the app.

Target `MacCatalystUTITest` should be run as a **Catalyst app**. Theoretically, using the same process as above, the file extension `.customuti2` should be associated with the app, but none of my tests have led to this association successfully.

There are sample `.customuti` and `.customuti2` in the repo to test with.
